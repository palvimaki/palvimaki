Hi I'm eepee original developer of Estibot.com and co-founder of Intelium.com

I'm kinda obsessed with workflow automation and tools, usually something 
to do with domain names, more recently studying cybersecurity. And turning these 
into web apps to share the tools.

Currently I'm delving into penetration testing with Kali Linux. T3h h4x0r stuff.

DISCLAIMER: IRL I'm a neurosurgeon so I'm not a pro at this stuff. 
Always trying to clean up my spaghetti & learn from the amazing pros I know.

Some random stuff I've done recently:

- https://domaintieto.fi dotfi namespace domain tool (full stack)
  Check out https://builtwith.com/domaintieto.fi to peek under the hood

- Telegram bot for automating a plethora of tasks, eg checking droplists, valuating drops, initiating 
  dropcatching, managing dan.com portfolio, interacting with Cloudflare, and other relevant APIs. 
  Telegram API provides a great mobile UI if you just wanna do the back end and get things up and 
  running in no time. 


Hit me up if you have ideas for collaboration or anything else :)

Always Be Coding!
